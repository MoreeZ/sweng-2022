Therefore, it can helps measure the overall accuracy of the model’s prediction. A log-error evaluation was performed on the test dataset, and a graph with predicted log-error and actual log-error was created.

MAE refers to the magnitude of\n                                    difference between the prediction of an observation and the true value of that observation.\n                                    MAE takes the average of absolute errors for a group of predictions and observations as a\n                                    measurement of the magnitude of errors for the entire group. MAE can also be referred as\n                                    L1 loss function. Therefore, the lower the value means smaller distance between predicted\n                                    and actual, which are more accurate.</p>\n                                <p>The MAE obtained for the model trained by XGBoost is 0.07000506510733166.
