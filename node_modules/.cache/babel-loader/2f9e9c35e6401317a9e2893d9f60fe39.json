Because machine learning models calculate the average of a series of mistakes, it has termed the mean squared error: the lower the MSE, the more accurate the forecast.</p>\n                  <p>We utilize ridge regression to construct our model to eliminate multicollinearity to a degree. The following graph is our result of mean squared error.</p>\n                  <p>The most important point is that we compared with most of the online published results for this competition, finding that most results fall in the range from 0.01 to 0.06. Via this comparison, our product has relatively accuracy of predictability.</p></p>\n              </>\n            } image={meanSqErr} />\n          </Col>\n        </Row>\n        <Row style={{ marginTop: \"50px\" }}>\n          <Col>\n            <QualityInfo title={\"Feature Selection\"} desc={\n              <>\n                <p>Based on the feature important graph and real-life meaning consideration, we choose the five features as our final features to predict the house price and log error.</p>\n                <ul className=\"text-start\">\n                  <li>'taxamount'\t:The total property tax assessed for that assessment year</li>\n                  <li>'finishedsquarefeet12' :\tFinished living area</li>\n                  <li>'bathroomcnt :Number of bathrooms in home including fractional bathrooms</li>\n                  <li>'bedroomcnt' :\t Number of bedrooms in home</li>\n                  <li>'yearbuilt'\t: The Year the principal residence was built</li>\n                </ul>\n              </>\n            } image={featureSelection} image2={L1Explanation} desc2={\n              <>\n                <p>The performance of Lasso for feature selection is not good as the relationship between the features, and the target variable is not linear.
