# Software Engineering Group Project 2022
## Regression/Classification/Deep learning based models.

We take any regression or classification use case and do our predictions. This is easier said than done. We need to follow all the assumptions of the algorithm that we use. We need to use various algorithms, stacking models. tons of parameter tunings and model use various model evaluation tests. I personally would go for regression model. Note: In all the models, based on the use case chosen a dashboard needs to be created.
